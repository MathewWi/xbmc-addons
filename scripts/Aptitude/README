This script will upgrade your system on an aptitude based distro.

install.py needs to be added to sudoers with no password, the script have no password entering logic as of yet.
To maintain security the install.py is best placed in a location were only sudo can write.

row 65 needs to contain an absolute path to the install.py (we relay the script to the systems interpreter thats why we need an absolute path)
    pathToInstallScript = '/foo/bar/install.py'

also python-apt needs to be installed.
sudo apt-get install python-apt
