- Enhancement - Added sqlquery command

                        RunScript(script.cinema.experience,command<li>sqlquery<li> .. your query ..)
                        test your queries out before trying them with the script(SQLiteSpy is a great tool for XBMC's default database)
                        example:
                            HTTP API -> RunScript(script.cinema.experience,command<li>sqlquery<li>SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview WHERE c14 LIKE '%%action%%' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 10)
                            Skin -> RunScript(script.cinema.experience,command;sqlquery;SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview WHERE c14 LIKE '%%action%%' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 10)
                            
                        A couple of SQL Queries:
                            
                            5 Random Movies from the Genre Comedy
                                SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview WHERE c14 LIKE '%%comedy%%' ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5
                            
                            5 Random Movies Based on actor Adam Sandler:
                                SELECT movieview.c00 FROM movieview JOIN actorlinkmovie ON actorlinkmovie.idMovie=movieview.idMovie JOIN actors ON actorlinkmovie.idActor=actors.idActor WHERE strActor="Adam Sandler" ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5
