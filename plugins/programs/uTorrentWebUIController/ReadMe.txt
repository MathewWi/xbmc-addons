News:
June 22nd, 2009 - After a few weeks of testing, the uTorrent WebUI Control Plug-in is officially released!

About:
This plug-in interfaces with uTorrents' WebUI and allows for uTorrent control directly from XBMC!
The plug-in benefits users with one connection and streaming video.  Simply control a small number of torrents
individually, or control the whole batch! Functions are available through dialog and context-menus.

Install:
1.) Enable WebUI
2.) Enable Token Authentication
3.) Install the plug-in
4.) Enter username and password via 'Plug-in Settings'
5.) Enjoy!

Updates:
Request features through email. Translation needed, as this plug-in uses localization.
